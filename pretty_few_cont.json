            "This place can be summed up in one word . flawless ! Located across the street from the most beautiful beach in Key West - Smathers Beach and literally 1.7 miles from Duval street it is prefect! The service was fantastic, the grounds are very well kept, with a cool pool. and the piece de Resistance . the room - comfortable, huge, it is literally the size of a small apartment, with a small kitchenette, a dining table a huge couch and and super comfortable bed, oh yeah and the bathroom is also pretty darn big. We had a magical weekend staying here and every went on without a hitch, good laid back service at a very reasonable price. This is the place to stay in Key West. Since we brought our bikes, we did not have to move our car at all in the 3 days we were there, Duval street is just a short ride from the hotel. don't own a bike? Or don't feel like shipping them down with you ? No problem, the hotel has plenty of bikes for rent as well.",
            "The hotel has a great location, across from the beach and away from Duval street, but a free shuttle every hour into town and airport. Rooms are all suites large and comfortable with microwave and wet bars, living room areas , well designed space with pocket doors to close off the bedroom for privacy. Comfortable beds and nice vanity area, lots of storage space. We were a large group and treated very well. The restaurant staff was particularly accomodating. As people in our group trickled into the restaurant , we kept adding to tables, asked for separate checks etc and it was never a problem. Many of us asked for a late checkout last minute and they accomodated as many as possible. Pool was heated and lovely, a hot tub in the corner. Restaurant closed at 9 and bar at 11pm, a little early for our crowd and Key West but that is my only complaint.",
            "The hotel was decorated beautifully for X-mas and I loved the Palm trees with Christmas lights! The staff was very helpful and friendly. The rate was what is to be expected for Key West, right by the airport! The beach is across the street from the hotel with multiple activities for one to participate in. Since the hotel is out of the was a smidge, they offer shuttles, numerous shuttles to all the hot spots in Key West. The rooms were beautiful, and very clean, unless you looked directly behind the toilet, which could use a little extra scrubbing. I would stay here again, tomorrow!",
            "The hotel is an all suite hotel so the rooms were very spacious and allowed us to kick back in our room mid afternoons and mornings. If you like a slower pace and a public beach across the street, this is a good place to stay. You will have to drive or take the shuttle to Duval Street area and the shuttle is only once an hour. Parking in the Duval Street area will cost from $10 to $35 per day.",
            "I took my girlfriend here for a long weekend and to propose. The hotel was great, obviously, it wasn't a St Regis or even a Westin, but it was very nice, very functional and enjoyable. The food and services were VERY expensive. I thought they took care of us well even though we were staying on points for free.",

This hotel is so close to the beach and is perfectly located for peace and quiet. The airport and Duval street is only a short shuttle away, but downtown is quite far away. Morden rooms with great size and a lot of storage space. The beds are super comfortable. The bathroom is also pretty large with a nice vanity area. The staff were even willing to help with last minute late checkout request. The restaurant provides great food, but it closes too early for us. The hotel actually has bikes to rent. Parking close-by can be very pricey per day. The elevators feel not safe."

The hotel is just across the street from Smather's Beach and is only a short walk, shuttle ride or bike trip away from Duval street. The rooms are large and spacious with lots of storage space and are clean with comfortable beds and also have a big bathroom. The vanity is very nice and the room is spacious enough to kick back in but also close to one of the few beaches in Key West. In the restaurant, the staff was very good. If at all possible the staff tried to accommodate late checkouts for all who requested it. Fantastic service. Although the restaurant closed at 9 and the bar also closed too early for the crowd, at 11. The food and staff was great. The hotel's elevators are not recommended to be used. Parking in the Duval Street area is pricey but the hotel has plenty of bicycles that are available to rent too."

The mature greenery of the courtyard had the serenity and grace of years of wise existence; of course we could relate!

It was a charming effect that would have been absent had we stayed in a concrete & glass megalith. We thoroughly enjoyed the ambience here. The breakfasts above the garden were special.",

The Italian people who run this place are really helpful with everything you need and provide great service with the breakfast buffet (we loved the mexican eggs in the morning) and free beachtowels. Playa del Karma is a lovely place with a beautiful garden with a small but wonderful pool, lovely to relax after a day at the beach.",

Right across from the new ADO bus station so a good place to stay if you are catching an early morning bus from the station. Just a couple blocks from 5th ave where all the action happens at Playa.",

It was a charming effect that would have been absent had we stayed in a concrete & glass megalith. We thoroughly enjoyed the ambience here. The breakfasts above the garden were special.",

The hotel is in close proximity to 5th Avenue Playa Del Carmen. The rooms are adequately sized, but comfortable, clean and with high-vaulted ceilings. Breakfasts were really good above the garden but also the breakfast-to-go option was great too. Unfortunately there was no private parking available here at this hotel."

We did hear the dog a couple of times but was it was only for a few minutes. Overall, I was impressed with their customer service. The staff was very nice and accomodating. Mario was very friendly. We arranged a couple of tours with karma trails and we were happy with the tours we chose. Antonello arranged a breakfast-to-go box before we headed out to one of our tours in the morning and it was abundant, filled with fruits, bread, water and cake.

The rooms are small and cosy in size, but they make it for it in character. The high vaulted thatched roof, although not soundproof, gives the room a much more airy feel to it and you can listen to the relaxing patter of raindrops.

This hotel is near the train station and one of the main vaporetti if you prefer a boat. It is located in an old monastery. All rooms of a good size, especially the family rooms. Good working amenities in each room and they have been cleaned to a high standard. It's highly recommended to eat the rich breakfast in the very charming garden in the mornings. The hotel does have issues with flooding, however there are boots available for guests to borrow if needed. Free Wi-Fi is also available at this hotel which is beneficial to many."

We were there to get engaged and as I had mentioned that to Angelo, within ten minutes of getting into our room a bottle of champagne was delivered up to us. The staff are absolutely lovely and I will recommend this hotel to anyone I know travelling to Rome. We hated to leave. To all of the staff in Hotel Raffaello, thank you for your kindness.",

It's away from the Branson chaos, beautiful quiet location and we always choose the lakeview condos. We don't have a boat so the marina down at Indian Point it perfectly located if we get in the mood to rent something. We're opposite the Silver Dollar City traffic if we want to go into town during the day and we're less than a mile away if we want to go to the park. It may be a bit of a drive if someone is intensely interested in going downtown or on the Strip a lot but the roads are good and it's not that big a deal for me! We always stay in the 2-bedroom condos, it's such a relaxing, roomy place to stay, so much better for us than staying on the Strip.",

Things like CN Tower, Rogers Centre/Skydome, the Eaton Centre, harbourfront, Hockey Hall of Fame, Union station and Dundas Square are all between 5 and 20 minutes' walk.

The hotel itself is clean and comfortable.

We paid a little extra for the \"Business Room\" which came with a bottle of water - although there was no fridge, a paper in the morning and Apple TV, which was a good to have after the show. The only faults: we were a disappointed when we asked downstairs for wine glasses on our way in, as we brought a bottle for after the show; and the pillows were a bit high/full for us - pretty minor.

The rooms are quite unique but a little disappointing, and the shower is like a horizontal MRI machine. However the beds are great. Aside from the unfriendly reception staff most of the hotel staff were very nice. The hotel has great food; from the small restaurant to the fry bar that promotes local organic produce with lots of variety. This is a great escape even in the city.

There isalso a small restaraunt in this hotel that had great food However, for us it was located a bit off course in the sense that is is not subway convenient. Further, because this is an old historic hotel, the rooms were small, coupled with a small bathroom. I do believe you can upgrade to a larger room but none was available at the time I reserved. As the elevator is original to the hotel, it must be staff operated. At times we had to wait for someone to attend to this. Our other choice was walking 3 flights of stairs.",

The Drake hotel is 200 yards up the road, double the price and has half the character.although very smart. Our room was small but adequate and well kept. The downstairs cafe serves great food, and while we were there there was live music and comedy every single night. The staff were very helpful and friendly and i'd definitely recommend the hotel for future stays. The Gladstone would particularly suit young couples looking for some culture, good food and music at a reasonable price.",

They have created unique spaces for musicians, artists, foodies and families.to showcase, perform and indulge. They support and promote local and organic eating ( by the way they have a FRY BAR.sweet potato, potato and taro too with tons of toppings). Harvest Wednesdays supporting field to table eating (yum) are not to be missed.and while you are there, you'll know why you need to try the Gladstone.",

The beds are reasonable, and there is the option to upgrade if guests would like to do so. The staff are mostly really nice and cool apart from upon arrival where the staff at that time were frosty. You can get great food from the small restaurant inside the hotel. The Gladstone has a great vintage elevator dating to the turn of the 20th century."

        "tgt": "If you can get a room which isn't overbooked this is a great place to base yourself to explore this amazing place. Excellent location as it is central to many of the major attractions in this area. You can simply walk to get to many places, and it is a great base to start at before going to explore what else there is on offer in the area. Rooms are very spacious with all amenities that are needed for a good night's stay. The rooms are slightly outdated but still look reasonably modern and are maintained to a good standard. Extremely friendly and helpful staff at this hotel, who are very attentive to the needs of their guests and go above and beyond to make them feel welcome. Hotel security requires seeing wristbands provided to its guests in order to enter the building."

The hotel is closely located to the Vaporetto station and ideal for those tourists who are cruising. St. Mark's Square is about an hour's walk away. It is located just 15 minutes away from the airport. The rooms are a little on the small side but do provide a nice view. Owing to very little noise it was fine to keep the window and shutters open. Inside the room it is beautiful.The restaurant Brucinellis in the hotel was okay but the view overlooking the canal was great. The photos are very reflective of how this hotel is in reality. It's really convenient that they let you leave your luggage there when checking-out so you can do other things for a while."

The front desk staff was very helpful and the dining room staff was great too. The Hotel is located about a minutes walk from the vaporetto station. You should buy an extended vaporetto pass if you are going to be in town for a stretch of time. The railway station was a short three minute walk away, and St. Mark's Square took about 1 hour at a leisurely pace to reach.",

Excellent selection for breakfast. I developed a health problem whilst in Venice and the reception staff could not have been more helpful and supportive in assisting me to resolve the matter. I would certainly stay at this hotel if we return to Venice. Our only criticism would be that the room was a little on the small side but as we spent a great deal of time sightseeing it did not affect our enjoyment of our stay.",

You can get to the airport by bus, cab, or water taxi practically from the front door. The room was small but had a nice view. We left the window and shutters open and it still was not too noisy, although there is activity going on almost all night. Small but usable elevator, which you don't always get. The location and ease of travel made it worth the price.",

The only complaint is that it is near the end of a vaparato route, and too far to walk at night from San Marco (unless you are actually familiar with the streets and alleys of Venice.) The restaurant, Brucinellis, in the same building was not so great. The bass was very disappointing, and I believe they refill the water bottles with tap water.",

When we complained, the staff said they had no rooms available that fit our confirmed reservation. They offered to give us a comparable room at a related hotel down the street, which turned out to be off the beach and much less nice than this hotel. We returned to reception to tell them the room was unacceptable and were eventually upgraded to a king room at the Outrigger Reef with a partial ocean view. Why they didn't do this first if they didn't have a regular king room I will never know, but it made us very grumpy to wait nearly two hours to get a room after a very long flight.The room was clean, but nothing special. It had a small outdoor patio, but overlooked the pool and many other patios, which made it very loud and not at all private.We would not stay here again.",

We never had a problem getting a chair at the pool. We spent most of our days going back and forth from the ocean to the pool - there is also a little sandwich, ice cram and smoothie shop right next door that we would eat lunch at on the beach that is pretty cheap.

I was lead to believe we had to valet, but we could have parked on the upper level on our own, and still paid the $13 per day. From what I understand, it could have been worse, some hotels charged as much as $18 per day for parking. There are so many hotels, restaurants and shopping in this small area of Wikiki, that there is no parking space, so you pay dearly for having a car. Every place we went there were also tour busses that would do the same routes, but we did it at our leisure, and stayed at each site as long as we wanted.

Poor points are very limited parking and having to go to basement to get a pool towel from Housekeeping versus poolside on 3rd floor. The AC units chill your room quickly. Breakfast buffet good deal for the money and their dinners are just as good as any other restaurant. Excellent location (beach, zoo, aquarium, shopping, etc) and easy to find. Rooms are dated but clean and larger than you'd expect for the price. I would definitely stay there again and plan to do so!",
            "Getting Pretty Bad Liike every one has said , the location view are wonderful , but then there's your room and the slow elevators. The rooms need a new face lift bad and the bathrooms are getting gross, I went to have breakfast with my family, and after waiting over 20 minutes for a elevator they where leaving the restraunt by the time I got there. And the tile around the pool is VERY SLIPPERY, my grandchildren fell many times. I would recommend this hotel only if it's all you can afford and you want to be close to the beach.",
            "great hotel good value We stayed at Queen Kap for 11nights to the 09 sept 04. It was great we requested an ocean view studio with kitchenette. The room was on the 8th floor had a view of diamond head, beach, pool and zoo! It was old but clean and very comfortable, and reasonably priced with every 5th night free and free buffets thrown in everyday too! Check their websites for specials. We will be staying there again its old but good and staff are friendly but request a room with a view and pay the extra! Mahalo",
            "Wonderful Value - Good for GLBT Customers If you are used to the Ritz-Carlton and the W Hotel, then this place is not for you. But, if you want a wonderful bargain right in the heart of Waikiki, this is great! And if you are a GLBT customer, you are right next door to Hula's and across the street from Queen's Surf Beach. I would definitely stay again. I got a great deal too. Stay 3 nights and get the 4th night free.",
            "Nice stay This was a pretty nice hotel. The location was great and very convenient. The amenities were nothing fancy, but definitely adequate. We got a balcony that overlooked the city and ocean and a sizeable bathroom; I couldn't really ask for more. This is definitely not a luxury palace, but I doubt anyone booking this hotel expects that!",

It's easy to find and the view from the hotel is great as well. The rooms at this hotel can be nice with views of the city or the ocean and even the zoo and even have good-sized bathrooms but other rooms have issues with smelling of mold and rooms and bathrooms in need of updating and cleaning. Staffing at this hotel is okay. They are knowledgeable and friendly but not extraordinary. As part of your stay, a free buffet is on everyday for guests to help themselves. This hotel has adequate amenities."

In any event, the rooms were really comfortable, though slightly on the smaller side. We were on the courtyard side of the building, and you'd never know you were steps from the mayhem on Bourbon. The complimentary breakfast was great, and the welcome drinks were a nice touch. Love the courtyard and pool - very upscale feeling, but cozy and completely non-pretentious. One downside to this being a boutique hotel: there's no housekeeping after midnight, so we had to walk down to get the extra towels the housekeeper never left. Also we had a hard time getting the shower gels refilled, and had to call to ask for this to be done. But otherwise the service was outstanding, especially Shawn at the front desk. I will definitely stay here again and recommend this place to my friends.",
            "We stayed at the Hotel le Marais for four nights and loved it. This modern, boutique hotel was clean and well-maintained. The beds were heavenly! The one issue in the room was that the shower would spray outside the stall, leaving huge puddles on the floor, so we had to have the shower head practically facing the opposite wall to avoid the mess. The staff was extremely helpful, particularly Pierre, who booked several tours for us and got us $10 discounts per person per tour. The best part of the hotel is that it is in the heart of the French Quarters. This visit was all of our first times in Nola.

This hotel sits in a perfect location and in walking distance to all the key landmarks. The rooms are clean and the bed is super comfortable. The only issue was the shower in the bathroom, which would spray outside the stall. The service was outstanding in general; the staff here at this hotel are both helpful as well as professional. But there were some small teething problems , for example the housekeeping staff don't work after midnight. The hotel offered really chocolates and gingersnaps in the lobby and free breakfast. Lovely pool area. The valet parking should be provided."

In any event, the rooms were really comfortable, though slightly on the smaller side. We were on the courtyard side of the building, and you'd never know you were steps from the mayhem on Bourbon. The complimentary breakfast was great, and the welcome drinks were a nice touch. Love the courtyard and pool - very upscale feeling, but cozy and completely non-pretentious. One downside to this being a boutique hotel: there's no housekeeping after midnight, so we had to walk down to get the extra towels the housekeeper never left. Also we had a hard time getting the shower gels refilled, and had to call to ask for this to be done. But otherwise the service was outstanding, especially Shawn at the front desk.

Breakfast served beautifully and elegantly with many choices, based on basic Italian breakfast of pastries, cold cuts, cheese, hard boiled eggs (with cute little cups and spoons), fruit and real coffee! Very small staff works hard to meet every need. Great place to have a drink before dinner in the lobby or on the rooftop balcony with view of the Arno.",

The room was pretty and clean, with a nice view of inner courtyard. Staff were friendly and very helpful, and we were close to all the main sights. The hotel balcony was lovely to sit around and watch the world go by and see the river below. I would recommend this as a good value, better than 3-star hotel and would visit again.",

It's also based in the centre of the city, so it is an excellent base for people to start from when sight seeing. The view is great because the hotel is set in such a beautiful location. There are transport links nearby however it is only a ten minutes' walk to the city centre. Whilst the room had a really good view in this hotel, the beds were incredibly hard. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and useful to help with directions and tourist information. You can also have a drink in the lobby before going to dine, or there is also a rooftop balcony in the hotel with a view of the Arno below. The hotel provided free internet access via a booth terminal in the lobby."

It is located across the street from the Arno in the San Croce area. Our daughter and I liked the location because this area of Florence was very clean and was away from the main hubbub of the city. There is a bus stop very close to the hotel. We arrived by train and took the number 13 to the hotel and the number 12 took us back to the train station. The staff is very accommodating and the reception area and breakfast area were very nice. The hotel also offerred free internet access.",

The cheerful, personal touch and helpfulness of the staff (particularly Salvatore the concierge who gave great tips re restaurants) made our stay an absolute pleasure. The view of the river Arno from our terrace was beautiful and the location was just right - a short walk from the centre but far enough away from the attractions so as to be quiet.The room was quite small but comfortable and clean and had a nice bathroom and a great shower.There was free internet access in the hotel lobby.We would highly recommend the Hotel River and would definitely stay there again next time we visit Florence.",

The hotel is located on a major shopping street, Clark Street and Century Mall is nearby which offers parking. There are also bus lines close by and many restaurants and bars to choose from. The rooms were always very clean even if you turn up slightly early. The sheers are lovely and soft and there are plenty of pillows. The room actually had a fridge and micro which is great because the building seems old but rooms are so modern. The hotel offers a great breakfast. This hotel offers free WiFi and additional security to get into the hotel but it can be difficult to park at the front for valet parking."

I can understand some one who says having the Singapore Sling as a memorable experience, to note as having done it. Tick it off as been there done that.

The place is full of tourists, Americans are there in large numbers. The toilets around the corner are totally out of character with the Raffles hotel in particular and Singapore standards in general. Hence try to avoid them.

            "We tacked on 5 days at the Shangri La staying in the Garden Valley wing at the end of our SE Asia Honeymoon and I cannot praise it highly enough, the garden valley wing is an all inclusive break and it's free champagne (Moet) and high class food from 11.00 am till 10.00 pm. The rooms are spacious and luxurious and the staff are very attentive, a reasonable location and a much better option than the faded grandour of Raffles.",

        "tgt": "This hotel is an ideal stay for those seeking both business and pleasure and with a few extras that aren't typical of most hotels in Singapore. This hotel isn't exactly central but taxis are pretty cheap and the hotel also provides a shuttle service for free. There is a large shopping area within walking distance as well. The rooms in the hotel were large, spacious and luxurious. The rooms were really clean with quiet air conditioning a pleasant surprise. The staff at the hotel had good attention to detail and the member of staff outside the hotel would always hail the taxi for guests. The hotel is all inclusive and guests receive free champagne in the lobby. The expense of the rooms if offset by a free afternoon tea, canapes and the provision of drinks. The breakfast buffet is particularly good, with the eggs benedict highly recommended. Brilliant amenities available for guests, including free Wi-Fi, a gym and a swimming pool."

            "As a regular business traveller to Singapore I always look forward to staying at the Shangri-La. Great service, attention to detail and the ever present taxi-hailer - make it feel like coming home. Rooms are spacious and comfortable with quiet aircon and welcoming tea and fruit. Room service is of a good standard and reasonably priced. One improvement could be to remember details such as non-smoking preferences - I had to really push for the hotel to move me to a non-smoking room, which they did have available, though at a higher level. Given i was checking in at midnight, for just one night, I really was disappointed that I had to push - who else would have taken the room at that time! That said, generally no complaints and a great hotel with a few extras that you don't always find in Singapore.",
            "You have to love the far east. The hotels are the best in the world and the Shangri la is up there amoungst the very best, From check in to the room every thing was seamless and calm. This is a word \"calm\" that i would use to describe the Shangri la a lot. The subtle touches like the changing of the carpet in the lift showing the day of the week, to cold water and iced face towels around the pool. Service cannot be faulted and the old world touch of kneeling to serve although a shock to someone from the west was done with such style and grace you grow to enjoy the gesture.",
            "All the good points have been made in previous reviews but I would like to just emphasise how good the service is here. I stayed in the Valley Wing and, though very expensive, the free afternoon tea, canapes and drinks go some way to mitigating against the high cost. The eggs benedict for breakfast was the best I've had and the Singapore Sling was far better at the Shangri La than the ready mixed mediocrity being served at Raffles. It isn't as centrally located as some hotels but taxis are pretty cheap and it's worth a few minutes in a taxi if it means you can stay at such a wonderful hotel.",
            "The Valley Wing at the Shangri-La is a must! Familiar atmosphere, the absolute friendly and warm staff members knew our name from the first day. In the Lobby all Champagne (Moet Chandon) is free, you will get a glass even when you wait 3 minutes for a taxi. Service is Top-end, nothing to do better. Rooms are beautiful and large, garden and pool-site are very relaxing, so I spent most of the afternoons in the pool with our baby-daughter. If you go to the Shangri-La, book the Valley Wing! Enter the Lobby, sit down, relax and sip your Champagne. Thanks a lot, Achem!",
            "Spent 2 nights at this fabulous hotel during a recent business trip. Excellant service and staff. Rooms are large and standard of cleanlines is very high. Wifi access free throughout the hotel with great connectivity. Hotel is within walking distance of the Orchard Road shopping area, however I believe the hotel also offer a free shuttle service. Hotel has a gym and swimming pool. Buffet breakfast was great, with a huge choice and fresh products.

            "I took a quick 3 day weekend trip to Toronto (my first trip there) with friends to see a ballgame and the Hockey Hall of Fame and take a quick tour of the city. The staff at the Grand was very friendly, helpful and attentive. Feeling welcome is very unusual in todays mega-chain hotels, but the Grand was top notch in that respect. Any flaws that the Grand may have vanish thanks to the staff and many complimentry features. Excellent free breakfast buffet, nice indoor pool and jacuzzi, two rooftop jacuzzis and sitting areas (make sure you use them on warm summer night!) and free gym. Underground parking is expensive, $19.00 per night, but I was not charged. The neighborhood is very colorful, but if you want a sanitized version of a city, stay on the Las Vegas strip. You will feel safe anywhere you walk in Toronto, and Toronto is a city that should be walked to be experienced.",

The hotel is in a not great area, but I felt safe, nonetheless. A bit outside of the city center, but the hotel itself is nice and it is close to a subway station, as well as a trolley line. Don't bother renting a vehicle, you won't need it! Also, the hotel offers a shuttle to sites within the downtown district. The swimming pool is very nice, and the roof space is very nice with plenty of seating and the hot tubs were great. The staff were attentive and very gracious. I would definitely stay here again.",

The hotel staff was pleasant, knowledgeable and helpful, with lots of tips for getting around. The location is not excellent - it's on the outskirts of downtown, and the neighborhood is a bit scary even for those of us from other large cities - but the hotel provides a free shuttle, and we were able to walk to restaurants and shopping without a problem. The pool room was hot and overchlorinated but adequate to calm down the kids before dinner. All in all, a nice stay, and we'd go back.",

Our room always looked spectacular, and the front desk staff was always extremely helpful. We ate a couple meals at the hotel which were both great. I would recommend this restaurant and hotel to anyone travelling into Toronto or that even live in Toronto! I've visited Toronto many times and love the city, yet i've never wanted to stay in the hotel so much before. The roof top was beautiful at night or in the day. If you want to mix a little luxury with the odd trip to Toronto then this Hotel is an absolute must.",

Complementary internet access was very useful in keeping in touch with family. We pretty much had the beautiful pool, whirpool, and locker room facilities to ourselves - also very clean. I will definitely be staying at the Grand hotel again.",

Watery scrambled eggs, pay extra for a cappuccino, bacon that died two days ago - apart from that though, a great hotel with terrific service. A short walk to the Eaton Centre and Yonge Street.

The hotel staff pleasantly provided lots of great local recommendations. The food here is okay including the hot and cold options for breakfast buffet. It is worth checking restaurants across the road as well. This hotel provides so many amazing additions, such as a nice swimming pool with hot tubs and locker room facilities, a beautiful roof top space with plenty of seating, and complementary internet access.

We were made to feel special from the moment we arrived in the hotel.We stayed on the gold floor with breakfast included this was outstanding we would highly recommend this hotel for a truly fantastic first class hotel in Torronto.",

        "tgt": "Beautiful historic hotel well worth visiting. It's of a large size with a grand lobby and there is a very charming atmosphere about the building. This location is great for all the best tourist hot-spots and sight-seeing in the city. The rooms were small and dark with dark furniture but the bed was comfortable and the furniture was modern. The restaurants in general are brilliant and the breakfast served is an excellent quality. Internet access is $16 from the hotel."

The lobbies were pretty nice, but we didn't hang out there or eat at any of the places. We walked most places (or took a cab if our destination was really far), even in the middle of winter. I try not to be too picky about these things, but our room was dusty the whole time we were there. It was enough to be noticed, so it should have been cleaned by the staff. Also, we weren't very fond of the bed. It was a bit on the hard side and wasn't exactly plus. It wasn't horrible though.

Once I was able to talk to the claims department she was no help at all. She basically called me a liar and we will not be getting reimbursed for the loss of our IPod.

The rooms were spacious but quite dusty and hot. The beds were adequate and the bathrooms were amazing. Some of the cleaning staff did miss an area that should have been cleaned. Unbelievably it was quite expensive just for a canned soft-drink from the minibar in this hotel room. The only available parking at the hotel is valet which can be costly.

There wasn't anything that had been left out, from the stereo playing when we entered the room to the weather report for the next day sitting on the night stand! The hotel is located right in the heart of Boston next to the Common and a few minutes walk to the waterfront, the possibilities are endless for restaurants and night life.

The bed is very comfortable and the fireplace makes it very cozy. It wasn't cold enough for me to really use the fireplace but I did anyway and cranked up the AC. The shower was also fantastic. I immediately declared that I needed to get myself a rainshower as soon as I was able! It is a pricey hotel but definitely worth it if you can swing it!",

Hotel car service was a great perk as well and we used it every night to go to our dinners around town.

The hotel provided some great food and every dish tasted great. Unfortunately the taps on the sinks were pretty tight and because it is an older building there seemed to be no soundproofing."

There wasn't anything that had been left out, from the stereo playing when we entered the room to the weather report for the next day sitting on the night stand! The hotel is located right in the heart of Boston next to the Common and a few minutes walk to the waterfront, the possibilities are endless for restaurants and night life.

The second I walked in the room, I knew that I wasn't going to want to leave and ordered myself some room service. It has a very classic style with every modern convenience you could hope for. The bed is very comfortable and the fireplace makes it very cozy. It wasn't cold enough for me to really use the fireplace but I did anyway and cranked up the AC. The shower was also fantastic. I immediately declared that I needed to get myself a rainshower as soon as I was able! It is a pricey hotel but definitely worth it if you can swing it!",

Hotel car service was a great perk as well and we used it every night to go to our dinners around town.

When in Boston city, the Mapparium is worth a visit, along with the top of the Prudential building, to get a great idea of where everything is. There are some great museums to visit.",

The hotel has easy travel into the city centre as as well as in walking distance to all the major sights you may wish to see. The rooms were elegant with a fireplace and comfortable beds. However the walls were quite thin. The staff were attentive and accommodating to all needs, even as far as the hotel car service etc. The range of foods provided by the hotel were excellent. One thing to note about the hotel is that the sink taps were on too tight to use properly."

Beautiful rooms at this hotel, with a cosy fireplace for guests to enjoy. Very elegant whilst also providing guests with a comfortable bed. The food was simply amazing.

            "I have stayed here three times -all on business trips where the hotel was booked for me. In fact, there are many meetings held here, and so you might find yourself surrounded by a large group of businessmen - not necessarily a bad thing -but just be aware. The two lifts are small and infrequent, and so you may have to wait a long time - which is annoying if you are on the top floors. The location is great for seeing Barcelona -you can reach most of the central sights by foot -including the Gaudi cathedral. Very near to a metro line , which is also a bonus. Rooms are fine -just try to get one facing the courtyard at the back -the ones to the front can be noisy. Biggest disappointment was the breakfast -17 for a very poor selection - definitely not worth it. I didn`t bother after the first morning.",
            "We got a really good deal on the rooms at this hotel and, therefore, it was worth what we paid for it. However, I would have been dissapointed if we had payed full price for this. We went in january which I know is not in season however, the terraces were closed and the pools were not open. They were also doing refurbishment works to one of the terraces, none of this was really communicated until you checked in. The room was a reasonable size as we had one at the end of a corridor and the bed was comfy. The bathrooms however, need some updating, they were tired and not in the best condition. Also be warned if you stay on the front of the hotel, the spanish like to beep their horns and this can be disturbing.",
            "Second time in this hotel and kinda disappointed. Rooms are ok and it is a good value for money mainly due to the great location on Paseig de Gracia, but the service does not seem to care so much about their customers. They are physically present behind the desk, but it stops here. It seems that they are breathing boredom. If you go to Barcelona for a short weekend and do not plan to spend too much time at the hotel, it'll be alright. If not, i'm sure you can pick a better place where the service will show you a more positive and customer focused attitude.",
            "The hotel staff was very helpful, rooms very modern with everything that we could think of. It is a short walk away from Gaudi's Casa Batllo, la Pedrera and a bit longer to la Sagrada Familia, the location couldn't be better! Within a couple of blocks it has many restaurants to chose from and can't forget to mention that it's in a great shopping area. From now on the place where we'll stay when visiting Barcelona.",
            "Great hotel! i can only think of a few things wrong with our stay, for one, breakfast was not worth the price paid and room service was a bit overpriced as well, but with such a wide variety of other places to eat in barcelona, it didn{t really mattter much. The standard room was small but then again the bed was huge! and the location. it can't get eny better!",
            "This hotel is located in a great location however is very expensive. If your looking for a place near Gaudi's buildings and shopping areas, then stay here.",
            "A lovely pillow menu.WOW.rooms excellent.location is very central and many many shops near the hotel, staff very helpful. A bit pricey but Lovely",

        "tgt": "The hotel, although a tad expensive, is a good option for a short stay in Barcelona. The front of the hotel can be noisy at time so ask for a room that is not facing the street. The hotel is situated near a metro line to get into central Barcelona. The hotel itself is a short walk from Gaudi's Casa Batllo, la Pedrera and just a little further to see La Sagrada Familia. The rooms are okay though on the small side at times. Bathrooms needed updating and some TLC but overall the rooms are good value due to the hotel's location. The hotel's staff was really very helpful. The hotel's breakfast was a bit basic and expensive for a 4 star hotel . The lifts in the hotel are a bit cramped and can take some time to arrive. The best rooms in the hotel are the ones facing the courtyard at the back, as the front side of the hotel can be noisy."

There is free WiFi here at the hotel and a great gym . The pool looks a bit different than pictures provided online and was on the smaller side therefore crowded.

We were then stranded due to the volcano and having enquired about staying for an additional five nights was told that we could have a special price of $39 per night - only to find out on the website for the hotel that the cost for that period of time would be $32 per night. Scammed! I would not recommend this hotel to anyone - there are far better places to stay which are closer to the amenities.",
            "This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel and both times have been totally trouble free. We stayed for 10 nights and had no problems. The room was clean and was cleaned every day, towels and bed sheets changed we came back every day to a spotless room. We only seen reception staff to check in and out but they seemed friendly enough and there were no additional charges over what we paid when we booked. The location is exellent, took about 10 mins to get to disney and about 20 mins to Universal and Seaworld. Aircon and tv worked well and there was always a parking space outside our room despite the hotel being quite busy over spring break. I will definatly stay here again if back in Orlando :)",

The hotel is situated in a great location only 10 minutes from Disney and 20 minutes from Universal Studios and Seaworld. The hotel is also close to a selection of restaurants. The rooms of the hotel are comfortable and affordable, but not big enough for more than two people. The air conditioning works well but the rooms can be unclean.The bar at the hotel is really reasonable and serves a really good Long Island iced tea. There is a lot of misrepresentation between the website and reality because the price in person ended up being more expensive than booking online, and the barbecue and lagoon areas were really not up to standard."

The rooms are quite small if more than two people stay here and the carpets weren't clean at all. Additionally to that there were bugs in the fridge and throughout the room. There was air-conditioning and a television in this room and that does make the stay a bit more welcoming. The drinks prices were acceptable and the Long Island Iced Tea was satisfactory. The pictures on the website were not an accurate representation of the hotel . The bbq and the lagoon are both below acceptable standards."

This hotel is ideally located for some of the main tourist attractions such as Disney and Universal, which is very convenient. It is also perfectly central to some of the big chain restaurants, which is perfect after a busy day sightseeing in a busy area. The rooms are too small and there are bugs in the refrigerator and the carpets need a good clean. The positives were that both the TV and the aircon worked fine and there was plenty of parking. The BBQ and lagoon are represented differently, in a much more positive way in the pictures than what they actually are."
